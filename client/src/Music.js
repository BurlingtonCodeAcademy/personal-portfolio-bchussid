                <h3>The Bubs</h3>
                <p className='bodyText'>The Bubs are a 10-piece white jumpsuit-clad punk group that I've had the pleasure of playing with for two years now. Truly a unique band that lets me get back to my roots of playing power chords in my basement a little too loud while simultaneously exploring new sonic territory.  When we have videos to share, I'll be sure to add them here but in the meantime I welcome you to visit our site <a href='https://www.thebubsvt.com/' target='blank'> here</a> or follow us on social media at the links below.</p>

                <h3>Wolfhand</h3>
                <p className='bodyText'>Wolfhand is an instrumental spaghetti western themed doom metal band. I know, that description is a lot but it's really the only way to put it. You have to see/hear it to know what I mean. This group has even less of a web prescence than The Bubs but we're working on it. Feel free to head on over to our social media pages or take a listen either on Spotify or you can buy our first full length record through our Bandcamp page which I've included below</p>
