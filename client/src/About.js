            <p className='bodyText'>Lorem ipsum dolor sit… just kidding. </p>

            <p className='bodyText'>I’m Ben. I'm an avid musician, surfer, and an aspiring programmer. </p>

            <p className='bodyText'> Originally from Buffalo, NY, I grew up and went to school downstate in New Rochelle. My favorite part about growing up there was the time copious amounts of time I got to spend surfing and fishing in Far Rockaway, Queens. Despite being located in Queens, the Rockaway’s, situated directly on the coast, gave me a deep appreciated for a quieter lifestyle. This appreciation was the motivation behind my decision to go to college at the University of Vermont. </p> 
            
            <p className='bodyText'>  I graduated UVM with a degree in biology but I look back on this time as being when I found my passion for music. I’ve been living in the greater Burlington area for 12 years now and in my time here (up until recently of course) I’ve been heavily involved in the local music scene as a live musician, recording artist, and instructor. One of my favorite parts of being a musician is being constantly challenged, having to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to unique problems. Wanting to apply these skills to a career, this is what led me down the path of web development.</p>

            <p className='bodyText'>I’m currently underway in the strenuously paced software development bootcamp at Burlington Code Academy. It’s been one of the more challenging yet rewarding six weeks of my life so far but I can tell it’s going to be well worth it. Though I am new and consider myself to still be a novice, I can feel my skills steadily growing. I am looking forward to continuing on this journey and am eager to constantly improve.</p>
