It's not much to look at or use at the moment but I'm looking forward to making improvements to the the content and layout of my page as I continue to learn how to do more - specifically adding more React elements to the page as well as more pictures, videos and music to make it more interesting for users to interact with. I enjoy simple websites but I would like to (and plan to) make mine a bit more involved. However this is where I'm at and I'm sure this will be the first draft of many.</p>
